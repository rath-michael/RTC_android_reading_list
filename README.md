## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my android mobile reading list app I completed as part of my Mobile Development class while attending Renton Technical College. The app allows a user to store, track, and categorize books they have read.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* Java
* Android Room Database

## Roadmap
* As this was a classroom assignment, I have no further plans for additions or improvements
